## Context
Luqa was created in December 2019 and is an e-learning platform focused on multimedia businesses.

The idea came to us as a result of the remark of a developing student who reported a lack of interactivity with his teachers when working from home. After discussion, we expanded our research on the other subjects proposed by our school curriculum.
The main functionality of the platform is e-learning. Teachers will be paid to write courses and correct student exercises, and students with a subscription will be able to consult them.
Another important feature is our online course tool. Verified teachers will be able to create courses for them and their class. They will be able to add a similar program ‚Äúchapters‚Äù to structure a course. Students joining the course can chat with the teacher via video conference or message. For dev sections, they can also, under teacher acceptance, edit the live code and comment it.
Luqa will also have a portion of small online courses available for free.
Our last equally important feature is the collaborative cloud for teachers, where they can share their course with exercises + corrected. The other teachers will then be able to buy them and offer them to their classes.
